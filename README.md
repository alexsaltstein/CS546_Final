**Using the Website:**

The first page leads you to the Login page. Here the user can input their login credentials to enter the site. If any credentials are incorrect or the credentials do not exist, a message will display.

If a user does not have a login, they will have to register, by clicking the link at the bottom of the Login Page.  It will take them to the Register Page. Here the user will have to register using an email to use the Flyer Creator website. Clicking register before all fields are filled out properly will reload the Register page. If the user has already registered, they can use the website by logging-in their credentials.

After they are logged-In they are led to the Home page, which is also a templates page, where the user can choose any one of the backgrounds for the flyer from the available templates.

The user has to click on the template they want to use for their flyer. By clicking on the template, they will be redirected to the Edit Flyer page.

This page allows the user to write their text and change the color and font size of their text. There is an option of editing four different text positions on the page. The flyer gets saved to the user&#39;s profile when the user edits the flyer and save the changes. Each time a flyer is saved, it adds another flyer to the database. The user will be able to save the flyer as pdf and share the flyer on Facebook from this page.

Note: While the share on Facebook button is there, it will not work because it is not locally hosted

The flyers created by the user can be viewed in the My Profile page, which displays their name and all the flyers they have saved. The user will be able to edit a flyer that they have already created by clicking on that flyer in their profile.

Clicking on the logout link in the navigation bar allows the user to get logged out. On the Logout page there is another link that will direct us to Login page.
